### Testing the GSVA Package ###

# Data Long Drive Repo #
Data in:
L:\Richard B\Analysis\2019\May 2019\testing_the_GSVA_package

# Richard Trial Data
See the 'rjb_trial' dir.
The 'rjb_trial_gsva_script.R' has a very basic explaination of GSVA using some made up data.
This shows enrichment in the S2 sample and also a downregulation enrichment in the S3 sample.

# GSVA Vignette 4.1 Functional Enrichment Leukaemia Example
Using the vignette example to find functionally enriched gene sets between two phenotypes (ALL and MLL).
The '4.1_functional_enrichment' dir.
The '4_1_functional_enrichment_script.R' has the 4.1 vignette example as a workthrough to understand it for me.
